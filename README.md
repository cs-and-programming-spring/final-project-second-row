This program is for users that are involved with a wedding. There are two types of users, guests that are signing in and the wedding planner who will create the wedding parameters.

 # Guests have the ability to:
  
        - sign in individually
        
        - choose a meal
        
        - book a room 
        
        
 # The Wedding planner has the ability to:
  
        - set the maximum amount number of guests to log in 
        
        - register up to three (3) meals for the guests
        
        - overlook all the guests that signed in 
        
                  (name, meal, yes or no if guest booked a hotel room)
