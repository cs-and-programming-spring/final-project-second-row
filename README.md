This program is for users that are involved with a wedding. There are two types of users, guests that are signing in and the wedding planner who will create the wedding parameters.

 ## Guests have the ability to:
  
        - sign in individually with their first name and last name
        
        - choose a meal
        
        - book a certain number of hotel rooms 
        
        
 ## The Wedding planner has the ability to:
  
        - set the maximum amount of guests to log in 
        
        - set the maximum amount of hotel rooms for guests to reserve
        
        - register up to three (3) meals for the guests
        
        - overlook all the guests that signed in 
        
                  (name, meal, a plus-one, number of hotel rooms they reserved)
