Gift Registry(Takes a Collection of gifts, the gifts will all be strings){
  Asks the user: "What would you like to do to the gift registry?"
  
  1 - Add a gift
      - First asks whether they will be giving an actual gift or just cash, cash will still be treated as a string.
      - If an actual gift, input the gift and add to the gift registry
      - If cash, input the amount of cash and add it to the gift registry
      
  2 - Remove a gift (There should be some way to retrieve a specific gift for this)
      - Input the "key" (either the guest giving the gift or a string equal to the gift).
      - The gift will be removed from the registry
      
  3 - View the registry
      - Prints out every gift item, and the giver of said gift. It's as simple as that!
