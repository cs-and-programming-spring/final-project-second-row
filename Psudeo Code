PSEUDO CODE FOR Alex-B
??? Ask a question about these areas
The registry will be a field, I assume

Gift Registry(Takes a Collection of gifts, the gifts will all be enums which will be part of a guest object){
  Ask the user "This is the Gift Registry. Would you like to purchase a gift?
  
If no
  - Exit this method / program
  
If yes
  - Ask them to pick which gift they want to buy. Maybe from a list?
  - Add the gift to the gift registry 
  
Afterwards ask the user if they want to view the registry

If no
  - Exit this
  
If yes
  - Print out all entries in the registry
